                    <h2>New England</h2>
                    <p>My journey started in Lawrence, Massachusetts where my ancestors settled after coming to the US from Italy. 
                        My parents grew up in Lawrence and met at the corner store where my dad would hang out with his friends. We lived in Lawrence until I was about 7 years old and then moved over the border to Salem, New Hampshire. 
                        I went to college in Plymouth, New Hampshire; a small college town up in the mountains. 
                        A few years after college, I bought a townhome in Haverhill, Massachusetts which I owned for almost 20 years.</p>

                    <h2>North Carolina</h2>
                    <p>In a trip to Florida January 2016, I made the decision to follow my dream of living in my paradise - the Fort Lauderdale, Florida area. 
                        As I was starting to prepare for the move, I met and starting dating a man who was planning to move to North Carolina. 
                        Our relationship was going so well, I decided to move with him. I figured if it didn't work out with him I was half way to Florida! North Carolina was nice but it wasn't anything like my dream. 
                        Although things were working out in our relationship, I was not happy being away from family and friends and what seemed to be the same climate as New England. A year later, I continued on...</p>

                    <h3>Florida</h3>
                    <p>In January 2018, I finally made it to my paradise. I now wake up to palm trees, warm breezes and water everywhere!</p>
